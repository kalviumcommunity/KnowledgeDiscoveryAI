# Dynamic Prompting Example

## What is Dynamic Prompting?
Dynamic prompting is a technique where the prompt is constructed or adapted in real-time based on user input, context, or external data. This allows the AI to respond more flexibly and contextually to different situations.

## Example Prompt

**Scenario:**
A user uploads a new article and wants a summary, but also wants the AI to highlight connections to their existing notes.

**Dynamic Prompt Construction:**
"Summarize the following article in three bullet points. Then, based on my notes about 'machine learning', highlight any relevant connections."

**Input:**
<Insert article text here>

**User Notes:**
<Insert user notes here>

**Expected Output:**
- Bullet point summary 1
- Bullet point summary 2
- Bullet point summary 3
- Relevant connections to user notes
