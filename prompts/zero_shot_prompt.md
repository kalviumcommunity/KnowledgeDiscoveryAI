# Zero-Shot Prompting Example

## What is Zero-Shot Prompting?
Zero-shot prompting is a technique where you provide an AI model with a task or question without giving any examples. The model must rely solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response.

## Example Prompt

**Prompt:**
"Summarize the following article in three bullet points."

**Input:**
<Insert article text here>

**Expected Output:**
- Bullet point summary 1
- Bullet point summary 2
- Bullet point summary 3
