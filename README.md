# Personal Knowledge Discovery and Synthesis System

## Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent system that automatically synthesizes new knowledge from a variety of sources, including your personal notes, web articles, books, podcasts, and other media. The goal is to help you discover new ideas and make connections across information that might not be immediately obvious.

## Key Features

- **Knowledge Gathering:** Collect data from articles, books, podcasts, and more using advanced web scraping tools.
- **Automated Note Generation:** Automatically generate and store notes from gathered information. For example, the system can transcribe podcasts and extract key insights.
- **Cross-Referencing & Synthesis:** Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to connect and synthesize relevant information from your knowledge base, surfacing new insights and relationships.
- **Creative Discovery Prompts:** Generate thought-provoking questions and prompts, such as:
  - What other industries could benefit from this idea?
  - What would happen if we combined [Concept A] and [Concept B]?
  - How does this new idea challenge conventional thinking?
- **Automated Suggestions:** Recommend articles, books, or other resources related to your current interests, based on detected patterns and similarities.

## Tools & Technologies

- Web scraping: [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
- RAG models for synthesis and summarization: (e.g., GPT-3, OpenAI Codex)
- Automation: cron jobs, task schedulers
- Database: for storing and linking notes
- Scripting: Python or Bash
